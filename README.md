# Detecting-Machine-Generated-Text-COMP90051-2023S1-Project-1
This project is about detecting the text generated by different LLM-given prompts and created by the subject team Statistical Machine Learning from the University of Melbourne. The instance is labelled by Human and Machine, and this project utilised both traditional machine learning methods and deep learning methods to classify the instance.

# Result of the project
According to the result from the private board, LGBM could achieve 76% overall accuracy to detect LLM-generated text:

# File Description
* `exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`: This notebook mainly focuses on data analysis, expecting to find insight into the data.
* `lgb-comp90051.ipynb`: This notebook utilises the LGBM classifier to detect the LLM-generated text.
* `gru-comp90051.ipynb`: This notebook utilises the GRU to detect the LLM-generated text.
* `transformer-comp90051.ipynb`: This notebook utilises the Transformer to detect the LLM-generated text.

# Exploratory data analysis
The project training dataset consists of human-written and machine-generated instances across two domains, each marked by significant imbalance. Each instance in the JSON files includes a preprocessed prompt and text, and initial exploratory data analysis has revealed distinct differences in prompt/text lengths and their standard deviations between human and machine sources.
