# Detecting-Machine-Generated-Text-COMP90051-2023S1-Project-1
This project is about to detecting the text generated by different LLM given prompts. The instance is labelled by Human and Machine, and this project utilised both traditional machine learning method and deep learning method to classify the instance.

# Result of the project
According to the result from the private board, LGBM could achieve 76% overall accuracy to detect LLM-generated text:
